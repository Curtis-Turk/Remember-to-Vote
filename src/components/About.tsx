      <h4>What is this?</h4>A service to help people vote in these May elections. It has been made
      by volunteer group <a href="https://www.campaignlab.uk/">Campaign Lab</a>, who use technology
      to improve campaigns.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      Register by entering your details below. On the morning of the election, we will send you a
      message with the address of your polling station.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Why?</h4>
      There is a new law in place requiring everyone to bring photo ID in order to vote. As well as
      sending you the address of your polling station, we want to remind everyone about this new
      photo ID requirement.

      <h4>What happens to my data?</h4>
      This site is part of a pilot to see if reminding people about the election increases voter
      turnout. As soon as the pilot is evaluated, all data will be deleted.{' '}
